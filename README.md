# Lunchbox
Welcome to Lunchbox, our capstone project for Web Development (CS4550) at Northeastern University. Since we spent a lot of time during class learning the MEAN stack, we chose to stick with it for our final project. We're hosting this bad boy on [openshift](http://lunchbox-rosedemaio.rhcloud.com/) for grading, but more importantly, for showing off to our *awestruck* families and *barely impressed* friends.
